Eat. More. Protein.
===================

I went Paleo in 2008 and have been geeked out on it ever since.  When listening to [Robb Wolf's Paleo Solutions Podcast](http://robbwolf.com/), questions often come up from folks who for a variety of reasons are not getting enough protein in their diet.  The typical prescription for an athletic adult is 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight.  Great.  How many grams of protein are in that chicken salad I just ate?  Let's put that in terms of food.
